          <p><strong>HOW TO PLAY:</strong> Begin the game by pressing 'START GAME'. When you do that, the instructions will disappear and the wordlist will move up. So, rtfm, friend! To attempt a word search, click or tap the first letter of the word, then the last letter.</p>
          <p><strong>SCORING:</strong> Words searched in the first minute of play yield 10 points each. That decreases to 5 in the second minute, 3 in the third, 2 in the fourth and 1 every minute thereafter. A bonus of 50 points is awarded for completing the puzzle in the first minute, 25 in the second, 10 in the third and five thereafter.</p>
            <p>Careful though, an unsuccessful word search will subtract a point from your score!</p>
          <p><strong>HINTS:</strong> You may click on any of the clues to get the actual word you're looking for, but that will also subtract five points from your score!</p>
          <p>The game must be running (i.e., the timer must be ticking) for you to interact with hints or the board!</p>
          <p><strong>HOW THIS ALL WORKS: </strong>Every time this page is refreshed, I try to rebuild a random puzzle from scratch. Like, even if the clues you receive are the same, the solutions may be in a different place on the board. Totally randomized. There are various factors that might prevent the puzzle from being generated correctly, and I'm working on that.</p>
          <p>For instance:</p>
          <p>
            <p>When I try to place all of the puzzle's solution words and the algorithm that does that finds that it is impossible to do so, that's a problem. When that happens you will see a game board without a solution to all of the clue words.</p>
            <p>I make calls to external services, one for the <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/">word list</a> and one for the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/">definitions</a>, and I can't control what kind of response they will return. Generally, they're pretty good. However, they may return a 429 to indicate they've gotten too many requests from time to time. You won't see that in your browser. But maybe count to 10 and then refresh.</P>

            <h5 style="color:#fff">If you know how to inspect your browser console: (Try F12 first)</h5>
            <p><strong>Safari: </strong>Option + Command + C</p>
            <p><strong>Chrome: </strong>Shift + ctrl + J (windows); Option + Command + J (Mac)</p>
            <p><strong>Firefox: </strong>Shift + ctrl + J (windows); Shift + Command + J (Mac)</p>
            <p><strong>Edge...</strong>CTRL + Shift + I. Note: this hotkey works on several different browsers, so if nothing's working in Chrome, Firefox or Safari, give it a try.</p>
            <p>The Wordlist is printed out in the console. You can cheat doing that. But you can also help me debug! Email <a href="mailto:220hertz@gmail.com?subject=Your%20stupid%20puzzle%20 doesn't%20work&body=Here%20is%20my%20experience:">me</a> if you encounter a problem!</p>
